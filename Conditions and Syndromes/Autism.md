# Mechanisms
- [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.4137/IJTR.S11355](Role of NAD+, Oxidative Stress, and Tryptophan Metabolism in Autism Spectrum Disorders)
> Studies suggest that oxidative stress-induced mechanisms and reduced antioxidant defense, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired energy metabolism (NAD+, NADH, ATP, pyruvate, and lactate), are major causes of ASD.

## Serotonin/Tryptophan
- [Tryptophan status in autism spectrum disorder and the influence of supplementation on its level](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11011-017-0045-x)
> These results assess that the Trp level in ASD subjects is critical and that intake of B vitamins and magnesium with diet might influence its metabolic homeostasis.

> Increased plasma cortisol/ dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate ratio is evident in ASD, and is significantly decreased by serotonin precursor administration
> Overall serotonin is relevant to ASD etiology and course and for some may be an important treatment target.

# Treatment
- [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3964746/](Redox Regulation and the Autistic Spectrum: Role of Tryptophan Catabolites, Immuno-inflammation, Autoimmunity and the Amygdala)
> many studies have shown efficacy of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory treatments, as well as treatment targeted to amygdala functioning, including hydrogen, oxytocin and NAD+, vitamin and mineral supplementation, naltrexone, DSMA metal detoxification, GSH and N-acetylcysteine. It should be noted that many of the pharmaceutical used to treat ASD are also powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, including antidepressants
