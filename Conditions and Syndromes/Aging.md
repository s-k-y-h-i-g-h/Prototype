## Rapamycin
- [Rapamycin for longevity: opinion article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6814615/)

## 17a-estadiol (Males Only)
- [17a-estradiol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17%CE%B1-Estradiol)
> Supplementation with 17α-Estradiol increases the median lifespan of male mice by 19%, while not affecting female lifespan. This treatment does not lead to feminization of male mice. 17α-Estradiol furthermore alleviates age-related metabolic and inflammatory dysfunction and improves glucose tolerance in male mice. The exact reason for this sex-specific increase in lifespan is unknown, however, the effect on male lifespan is gone in castrated mice, suggesting that the metabolic response to 17α-Estradiol requires the presence of male gonadal hormones. Whether these results are translatable to humans is currently unknown.

## Melatonin
- [Melatonin as an Anti-Aging Therapy for Age-Related Cardiovascular and Neurodegenerative Diseases](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9204094/)
>  exogenous melatonin has been proposed as a multitasking molecule capable of retarding several processes related to aging such as circadian rhythm dysregulation, metabolic alterations, inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects of melatonin, especially at the mitochondrial level, may exert protective actions against inflammaging processes. Thus, exogenously administered melatonin may prevent and mitigate multiple cardiovascular diseases, as well as neurodegenerative pathologies such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, whose development and advance are preceded and influenced by inflammaging events

## Polyamines (Spermidine, Spermine, Putrescine)
- [Polyamines in aging and disease](https://www.aging-us.com/article/100361/text?form=MG0AV3)
> Changes in polyamine levels have been associated with aging and diseases. Their levels decline continuously with age and polyamine (spermidine or high-polyamine diet) supplementation increases life span in model organisms.

> There are supplements and nutrients that may help delay or prevent further graying by supporting hair health and melanin production.  
> Here are some options:
> - **Catalase**: This enzyme helps break down hydrogen peroxide, which can accumulate in hair follicles and contribute to graying.  
> - **Vitamin B12**: Deficiency in this vitamin is linked to premature graying. Ensuring adequate intake through diet or supplements can help.  
> - **Biotin (Vitamin B7)**: Supports overall hair health and may help maintain natural pigmentation.  
> - **Copper**: Plays a role in melanin production, which gives hair its color.  
> - **Fo-Ti (He Shou Wu)**: A traditional Chinese herb believed to promote hair pigmentation and delay graying.
