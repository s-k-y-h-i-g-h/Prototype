# Mechanisms of Aging
- [Molecular mechanisms of aging and anti-aging strategies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11118732)
> - Mitochondria
> - Autophagy
> - NAD+
> - Stem cell exhaustion
> - Telomere shortening
> - Cellular senescence

These are inter-dependent. Fixing one helps fix the others. (source?)

## 17a-estadiol (Males Only)
- [17a-estradiol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17%CE%B1-Estradiol)
> Supplementation with 17α-Estradiol increases the median lifespan of male mice by 19%, while not affecting female lifespan. This treatment does not lead to feminization of male mice. 17α-Estradiol furthermore alleviates age-related metabolic and inflammatory dysfunction and improves glucose tolerance in male mice. The exact reason for this sex-specific increase in lifespan is unknown, however, the effect on male lifespan is gone in castrated mice, suggesting that the metabolic response to 17α-Estradiol requires the presence of male gonadal hormones. Whether these results are translatable to humans is currently unknown.

## CoQ10
- [Coenzyme Q10 Supplementation in Aging and Disease](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5807419/)
> There is evidence that supplementation positively affects mitochondrial deficiency syndrome and the symptoms of aging
>  Cardiovascular disease and inflammation are alleviated by the antioxidant effect of CoQ10

## Glycine
- [Glycine and aging: Evidence and mechanisms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163723000818?via%3Dihub)
>  evidence suggests that glycine prolongs life by mimicking methionine restriction and activating autophagy.

## Reading
- [Reading Skills: How Many Pages Should You Read per Hour?](https://selfimprovepublishing.com/reading-skills-how-many-pages-should-you-read-per-hour/)
> According to Bustle, who quotes a study, the sweet spot is 30 minutes of reading each day to live longer than those who read less. This means roughly 20 pages each day will be beneficial.

## L-Carnosine
- [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27344459/](Carnosine and the processes of ageing)
> [L-] Carnosine's possible anti-ageing mechanisms are therefore discussed; the evidence suggests that inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin and carbonyl scavenging may be involved.

## Statins

> it's levels go up with mortality
To get it down:
> eat less, eat more vegetables, anti-inflammatories
> get your CRP measured by your doctor

## Fisetin
- [How does fisetin improve longevity?](https://longevity.technology/lifestyle/how-does-fisetin-improve-longevity)
> Many research studies on longevity and antiaging have included fisetin as a potential substance from plants to prolong lifespan. Fisetin can potentially increase lifespan by 10 percent by reversing aging’s natural process and preventing diseases related to aging.

> the combination of dasatinib and quercetin is the oldest of the senolytic treatments used in animal studies. Senolytic therapies are those that selectively destroy senescent cells in old tissues in order to produce rejuvenation, turning back the progression of numerous age-related conditions.
