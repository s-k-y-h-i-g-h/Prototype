# Mechanisms of Aging
- [Molecular mechanisms of aging and anti-aging strategies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11118732)
> - Mitochondria
> - Autophagy
> - NAD+
> - Stem cell exhaustion
> - Telomere shortening
> - Cellular senescence

These are inter-dependent. Fixing one helps fix the others. (source?)

## 17a-estadiol (Males Only)
- [17a-estradiol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17%CE%B1-Estradiol)
> Supplementation with 17α-Estradiol increases the median lifespan of male mice by 19%, while not affecting female lifespan. This treatment does not lead to feminization of male mice. 17α-Estradiol furthermore alleviates age-related metabolic and inflammatory dysfunction and improves glucose tolerance in male mice. The exact reason for this sex-specific increase in lifespan is unknown, however, the effect on male lifespan is gone in castrated mice, suggesting that the metabolic response to 17α-Estradiol requires the presence of male gonadal hormones. Whether these results are translatable to humans is currently unknown.

## CoQ10
- [Coenzyme Q10 Supplementation in Aging and Disease](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5807419/)
> There is evidence that supplementation positively affects mitochondrial deficiency syndrome and the symptoms of aging
>  Cardiovascular disease and inflammation are alleviated by the antioxidant effect of CoQ10

## Reading
- [Reading Skills: How Many Pages Should You Read per Hour?](https://selfimprovepublishing.com/reading-skills-how-many-pages-should-you-read-per-hour/)
> According to Bustle, who quotes a study, the sweet spot is 30 minutes of reading each day to live longer than those who read less. This means roughly 20 pages each day will be beneficial.
