# Low Tyrosine Availability in the Brain
- [Support for limited brain availability of tyrosine in patients with schizophrenia.](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-03259-012)
> One line of research suggests that patients with schizophrenia have altered brain levels of the essential amino acid tyrosine, the precursor for the synthesis of dopamine. The most common hypothesis is that less tyrosine is available because of competition with elevated levels of other amino acids. By consequence, the synthesis of dopamine in the brain will decrease. In contrast, another line of evidence suggests a change in the affinity for one of the transport proteins.
- [Kinetics of tyrosine transport and cognitive functioning in schizophrenia](https://www.academia.edu/18099659/Kinetics_of_tyrosine_transport_and_cognitive_functioning_in_schizophrenia)
> A lack of tyrosine for dopamine synthesis with impairment of dopaminergic transmission could impair cognitive functioning. Aberrant tyrosine kinetics in patients with schizophrenia might therefore be associated with cognitive dysfunction—a core feature of schizophrenia.
>  Changes in tyrosine transport probably influence cognitive functioning via the dopamine system.

> Adjunctive melatonin therapy has some positive outcomes for sleep, metabolic profile and tardive dyskinesia in patients with schizophrenia. No beneficial effect of melatonin was observed on outcomes of cognition or benzodiazepine discontinuation.
- [Melatonin: an overlooked factor in schizophrenia and in the inhibition of anti-psychotic side effects](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11011-012-9307-9)
> Melatonin levels and melatonin circadian rhythm are significantly decreased in schizophrenic patients. The adjunctive use of melatonin in schizophrenia may augment the efficacy of antipsychotics through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. Further, melatonin would be expected to improve sleep disorders in schizophrenia and side effects of anti-psychotics, such as tardive dyskinesia, metaboilic syndrome and hypertension. It is proposed that melatonin also impacts on the tryptophan catabolic pathway via its effect on stress response and cortisol secretion, thereby impacting on cortex associated cognition, amygdala associated affect and striatal motivational processing. The secretion of melatonin is decreased in schizophrenia, contributing to its etiology, pathophysiology and management. Melatonin is likely to have impacts on the metabolic side effects of anti-psychotics that contribute to subsequent decreases in life-expectancy.
