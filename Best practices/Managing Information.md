# Logs
You should log exercising and consumption of supplements, medicines and drugs in a spreadsheet and back it up with Google Drive or MS OneDrive or Dropbox. If you find yourself suddenly being unproductive or encounter other problems then you can refer to your logs to see what lead to the problem. This will allow you to develop strategies for preventing the problems from happening again.

# Habit Tracking
Adherence to your daily tasks should be logged with a habit tracking app. There is an open source (free) app called Habits on F-Droid.

# Tasks
You should use a bug/issue/feature tracker like Jira to keep track of your personal tasks, new ideas, pet projects and professional work.

# Notes
You should write down ideas in Obsidian/Notion/AnyType/OneNote. Consider that you might only have some ideas once in your life and they could be beneficial for you or society. When I started to write everything down I was shocked that the volume of ideas was so high.
