# Notes
You should write down ideas in Obsidian/Notion/AnyType/OneNote. Consider that you might only have some ideas once in your life and they could be beneficial for you or society. When I started to write everything down I was shocked that the volume of ideas was so high.

If you intend to share your notes/articles with other people then you should consider hosting a project in GitHub and writing everything in Markdown like I have done with prototype. It's a zero click hosting solution.
