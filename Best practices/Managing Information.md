# Logs

Logging certain things can give you the benefit of being able to figure out why you act the way you do.

# Exercise Log

# Consumption Log
You should log exercising and consumption of supplements, medicines and drugs in a consumption log.

If you find yourself suddenly being unproductive or encounter other problems then you can refer to your logs to see what lead to the problem. This will allow you to develop strategies for preventing the problems from happening again.

# Habit Tracking
Adherence to your daily tasks should be logged with a habit tracking app. There is an open source (free) app called Habits on F-Droid.

# Tasks
You should use a bug/issue/feature tracker like Jira to keep track of your personal tasks, new ideas, pet projects and professional work.

# Notes
You should write down ideas in Obsidian/Notion/AnyType/OneNote. Consider that you might only have some ideas once in your life and they could be beneficial for you or society. When I started to write everything down I was shocked that the volume of ideas was so high.

# Public Notes
If you intend to share your notes/articles with other people then you should consider hosting a project in GitHub and writing everything in Markdown like I have done with prototype. It's a zero click hosting solution.

# Backups
You should host everything on Google Drive or OneDrive or Dropbox or similar. With spreadsheets just save them in your drive. Obsidian/Notion/AnyType/OneNote will either have a plugin for this or you can just save them directly to your drive.
