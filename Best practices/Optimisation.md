This article describes strategies for optimising your diet and supplement stack for getting the most out of a drug.

Plan for electrolyte levels changing because of:
- Diuretics
- Increased sweating

Figure out what the optimal blood PH for the drug is. E.g. amphetamine duration can be increased considerably this way.

Drink electrolyte drinks when eating less food.

When to consume salt and water:
- When you are well below RDA
- When you fall asleep briefly while sitting down
- Possibly when you keep accidentally clicking your mouse buttons because your muscles are acting weird
- When your jaw is clenching (make sure Mg RDA is met too)

When to respond ASAP:
- Sweating excessively
- Urinating too frequently 

This is dangerous because it will run down your stores of both water and electrolytes. This should be treated as a serious red flag.
