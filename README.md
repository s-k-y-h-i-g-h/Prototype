## Glossary

- **Stack**: A combination of substances which provide various benefits which are taken together. Most substances are consumed daily. Some substances are consumed several times a day.
- **Essential nutrients**: Nutrients your body needs and cannot produce on its own.
- **Nootropics**: 
- **Green Pill/Green Pilled**: A process which dramatically transforms who a person is and what they are capable of. This is like *red pill/red pilled* but more practical and very much unlike *black pill/black pilled* which I won't even explain here because it is so horrible.
