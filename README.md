## Glossary
- **Trans·hu·man·ism**  
    > *[tranzˈ(h)yo͞oməˌnizəm, tran(t)sˈ(h)yo͞oməˌnizəm]*  
    > *noun*

- **Stack**: A combination of substances which provide various benefits which are taken together. Most substances are consumed daily. Some substances are consumed several times a day.
- **Essential nutrients**: Nutrients your body needs and cannot produce on its own.
- **Nootropics**: 
- **Green pill/green pilled**: A process which dramatically transforms who a person is and what they are capable of. This is like *red pill/red pilled* but more practical and very much unlike *black pill/black pilled* which I won't even explain here because it is so horrible.
- **Wakespan**: how much of the time that you are alive you spend being awake.
- **Mass manslaughter**: Cutting funding for disease prevention programs.

# Stacks
## Modular Stack
Instead of coming up with one huge stack, we have broken things down into smaller goal orientated stacks. Some modules come in several flavours. If two stacks contain the same thing then only take that thing once - remove duplicates from the final stack that you are going to use.

| Module Name                                                                      | Description                                                            |
