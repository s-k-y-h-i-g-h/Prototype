# Introduction

A [transhumanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism) approach to life.

## Glossary
- **Trans·hu·man·ism**  
    > *[tranzˈ(h)yo͞oməˌnizəm, tran(t)sˈ(h)yo͞oməˌnizəm]*  
    > *noun*  
    > *transhumanism (noun)*  
    > the belief or theory that the human race can evolve beyond its current physical and mental limitations, especially by means of science and technology.  
- **Stack**: A combination of substances which provide various benefits which are taken together. Most substances are consumed daily. Some substances are consumed several times a day.
- **Essential nutrients**: Nutrients your body needs and cannot produce on its own.
- **Nootropics**: 
- **Green Pill/Green Pilled**: A process which dramatically transforms who a person is and what they are capable of. This is like *red pill/red pilled* but more practical and very much unlike *black pill/black pilled* which I won't even explain here because it is so horrible.
- **Wakespan**: how much of the time that you are alive you spend being awake

# Stacks
## Modular Stacks
Instead of coming up with one huge stack, we have broken things down into smaller goal orientated stacks. Some modules come in several flavours. If two stacks contain the same thing then only take that thing once - remove duplicates from the final stack that you are going to use.

| Module Name                                                                      | Description                                                            |

Longevity - Biolab + Crispr. Stem cell renewal (step 1).
for slowing down aging otherwise. matrix enhancement exercises is great.
mainly. Nei gung tai chi.
CatVader — 22:46
also. matrix enhancement increases physical performance by alot...

ijustwantyoutofeelsomething — 23:43
so here's the genes you can target for longevity:
TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase): keeps telomeres long
FOXO3a: controls stress resistance + longevity
Klotho: neuroprotection, age delay
SIRT1–7: sirtuins = mitochondrial integrity + DNA repair
P53: tumor suppressor, but it’s a double edged blade, too active = early death, not enough = cancer buffet
Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC): cellular reprogramming back to stem cell mode
partial expression = rejuvenation
full expression = congrats you’re a tumor now

and yes people have done this look up Elizabeth Parrish (BioViva CEO): used gene therapy on herself in 2015 (TERT + myostatin inhibitor). Claimed telomere extension

which substances would you use if you were trying to become a world leader?
srs question
chinito — 13:50
None
ijustwantyoutofeelsomething — 13:54
srs question deserves a srs answer so we'll need something for surviving the pressure of being Atlas while smiling at cameras things like: modafinil, low dose LSD or microdosed psilocybin, phenylpiracetam,  ashwagandha + rhodiola rosea, alpha GPC + uridine monophosphate, propranolol, selegiline (low dose), NAD+ precursors (like NMN) 
and if the world’s gonna worship or hate you you need something that keeps your ego in check while amplifying vision Ibogaine or 5-MeO-DMT once or twice in your life just to see yourself die come back and remember why you're leading in the first place
