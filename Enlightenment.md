# Definitions

This is the cessation of suffering. Expident means are sometimes recommended to reach a state of enlightenment. This article is a collection and mish mash of definitions and practices from multiple religions and schools of thought. The thing that I am adding is a transhumanist element. I believe and have experienced the cessation of suffering through technological and scientific means. I am just another example. I am nobody. Please bear that in mind.

# Expident Means
- [Definition](https://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/ott/PART-1/2)
> (Translator’s note: According to Words and Phrases, there are three types of hōben, or expedient means. The first is known as hōyū hōben, or “adaptations of the Law expedient means,” teachings that were preached in accordance with people’s capacities and tastes. They stress the truth of impermanence and the severing of attachment to the phenomenal world and correspond to Hinayana and early Mahayana. The second is called nōtsū hōben, or “expedient means that can lead one in,” teachings that the Buddha preached as a gateway to the true teaching. The third is called himyō hōben, or “the secret and wonderful expedient means,” which corresponds to the ultimate truth. “Secret and wonderful” refers to the fact that the Buddha concealed the truth for the first more than forty years of his preaching life, explaining it only in the Lotus Sutra. Unlike the first two expedients, the third type not only leads people to the truth but simultaneously contains the truth.)

## Moksha

> is a term in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism for various forms of emancipation, liberation, nirvana, or release. In its soteriological and eschatological senses, it refers to freedom from saṃsāra, the cycle of death and rebirth. In its epistemological and psychological senses, moksha is freedom from ignorance: self-realization, self-actualization and self-knowledge.
