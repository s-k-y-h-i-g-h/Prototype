> acute morphine administration increases serotonin (5-HT) transmission within the nucleus accumbens and other forebrain region

> Over 80 clinical trials with transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) and 
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) have been reported although very few of 
them on opioid use disorder (Verdejo-Garcia et al., 2019). This suggests a 
possibility for using such techniques as an adjuvant to conventional addiction 
treatments, to reduce drug craving, improving cognitive control, and mitigating 
withdrawal negative affect 
> A recently published tES study 
(reported that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the right 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex significantly reduced drug craving, depression, and 
anxiety symptoms amongst people with opioid use disorder
> In another study by Wang et al., 2016, bilateral tDCS over frontal and 
temporoparietal regions reduced craving scores in heroin users (Wang et al., 2016). 
In another trial, Shen et al. reported that a single session of 10 Hz repetitive TMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex reduced cue-induced craving in heroin users
> A few years later, the same group reported that use of a 
similar TMS protocol in multiple sessions improved sleep quality and low 
mood/increased anxiety among a mixed group of opioid and methamphetamine
