This is intended to provide a wide (covering many topics) and shallow (only explaining specific things which are useful for a biohacker to know) understanding of the body and brain and their interactions with environment and other people. This will take you from, for example, using nootropics to improve your memory to using food, supplements, medicines and drugs to exert effects on specific structures and mechanisms in the body and brain in order to achieve specific effects.

# Glossary
- **ACh**: acetylcholine
- **GABA**: gamma-aminobutyric acid
- **5-HT**: serotonin
- **DA**: dopamine
- **NE**: norepinephrine
- **Ligand**:

# Overview
Nerves are composed of bundles of neurons. Ions can cause neurons to fire.
> - Voltage-gated [ion] channels are key to propagating the signal within a neuron
> - Ligand-gated [ion] channels help transfer the signal between neurons

# Nervous System
## Afferent Limb
### Causes of Underreactive Baroreceptors
Generated by MS Co-Pilot:
> - Aging Baroreceptor sensitivity naturally declines with age, reducing the body’s ability to buffer blood pressure swings.
> - Hypertension Chronically elevated blood pressure can desensitize baroreceptors, shifting their “set point” and dulling their feedback loop.
> - Autonomic Dysfunction Disorders like baroreflex failure, diabetic neuropathy, or brainstem lesions can impair the afferent or efferent limbs of the reflex arc.
> - Medication Effects Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or certain sedatives can interfere with baroreceptor signaling or downstream autonomic responses.
> - Structural Damage Injury to the carotid sinus, aortic arch, or nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) can disrupt baroreceptor input or integration.

# Autonomic Nervous System
## Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)
Generated by MS Co-Pilot:
> - Heart: Increases heart rate and force of contraction
> - Lungs: Dilates bronchial tubes for more airflow
> - Digestive system: Slows motility and secretion—diverts energy away
> - Pupils: Dilate (mydriasis) to enhance vision
> - Saliva: Decreases production
> - Urinary system: Inhibits urination (relaxes bladder, contracts sphincter)
> - Adrenal glands: Stimulate release of adrenaline and noradrenaline
> - Liver: Converts glycogen to glucose for quick energy

### Primary Neurotransmitters
Generated by MS Co-Pilot:
> - **ACh**: All sympathetic preganglionic neurons release ACh onto nicotinic receptors in sympathetic ganglia.
> - **NE**: Most postganglionic sympathetic neurons release norepinephrine onto target organs.
> - **Epinephrine**: Released by the adrenal medulla (stimulated by ACh from preganglionic fibers). Acts systemically to reinforce sympathetic effects—especially during acute stress.

### Modulatory Neurotransmitters
Generated by MS Co-Pilot:
> - **DA**: Acts as a precursor to norepinephrine and modulates sympathetic tone in the brainstem.
> - **5-HT**: Can inhibit or facilitate sympathetic output depending on receptor subtype and brain region.
> - **GABA**: Inhibitory neurotransmitter that can suppress sympathetic activity via central pathways. Reduces SNS activity when baroreceptors detect increased blood pressure.

## Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS)
Generated by MS Co-Pilot:
> - Heart: Slows heart rate and reduces cardiac output
> - Lungs: Constricts bronchial tubes, reducing airflow
> - Digestive system: Increases motility and secretion—stimulates digestion
> - Pupils: Constrict (miosis)
> - Saliva: Increases production
> - Urinary system: Promotes urination by contracting the bladder
> - Sexual function: Supports arousal (e.g. erection in males)

### Primary Neurotransmitters
- ACh

### Modulatory Neurotransmitters
- GABA
- 5-HT
- DA
- NE

### Causes of Underreactive PNS
Generated by MS Co-Pilot:
> - Chronic Stress or Trauma Persistent sympathetic dominance (fight-or-flight) can suppress parasympathetic tone, leading to poor vagal rebound and dysregulated recovery.
> - Autonomic Neuropathy conditions like diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, or multiple system atrophy can damage parasympathetic fibers, especially the vagus nerve.
> - Inflammation or oxidative stress systemic inflammation can impair vagal signaling and reduce heart rate variability—an indirect marker of parasympathetic activity.
> - Medications anticholinergics, some antidepressants, and stimulants can blunt parasympathetic output by blocking acetylcholine or vagal tone.
> - Poor sleep, overtraining and inadequate recovery can suppress parasympathetic reactivation, especially in athletes or high-performers.

## Enteric Nervous System (ENS)
Sometimes called the "second brain".

# Neurotransmitters

# Increasing Receptor Activity

## Increase Number of Ligands
### Rate Limited Biosynthesis

## Increase Number of Receptors
Generated by MS Co-Pilot:
> One ligand molecule binds to one receptor at a time. But the bigger picture isn’t about molecules magically multiplying—it’s about probability and population dynamics.
> 
> Let’s say you have:
> - 100 molecules of ligand
> - 100 receptors in one scenario
> - 1,000 receptors in another
>
> In both cases, the ligand pool is the same.
>
> More receptors = more “parking spots.” Even if ligand concentration is unchanged, there's a higher chance that any given molecule will encounter a free receptor before degrading or getting reabsorbed. That can result in faster or more sustained signaling, especially in synaptic environments where proximity and timing are critical.

### Spare Receptors
Generated by MS Co-Pilot:
> Some systems operate with spare receptors, where only a fraction need to be occupied to trigger a full downstream response (like G-protein cascades).
> So if you double receptor count:
> - Even partial occupancy could trigger stronger or more prolonged effects,
> - Or allow sub-threshold ligand levels to start producing a noticeable response.

## Increase Receptor Coupling to G-proteins/Ion Channels
Increasing this causes a receptor to more effectively convert the signal from a ligand into a cellular action.
