Add whatever anti-psychotic you have been prescribed. Adjust magnesium dosage as needed after analysing your diet.

I experimented with lower doses after you I had been on this stack for a while. My personal experience is that I need less Olanzapine (1/4 my prescribed dose) when taking this stack. YMMV.

Olanzapine alone did not silence the voices I was hearing but this stack did (even when devoid of Olanzapine). I still take Olanzapine because the stack has not fixed the delusions.

# Practices
