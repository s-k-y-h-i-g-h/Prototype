> mounting evidence supports the link between HSV-1 infection and AD development, HSV-1 may also be associated with the prodromal stage of AD, aMCI
> 

> study in Taiwan reported that individuals diagnosed with recurrent HSV-1 infection had a 2.8-fold higher risk of developing AD than uninfected individuals
> 

> More importantly, antiherpetic medications reduced such risk by about 90% compared to placebo
> 

> antiherpetic treatment was associated with a 10% reduced risk of dementia
> 

> In untreated patients, the risk of dementia increased by 50% compared to uninfected controls
> 

> persons with HSV infection who were not given anti-herpetic medication had 18% higher risk of dementia compared to uninfected controls
> 

> HSV-1-seropositive older adults, antiherpetic prescription was associated with 70% lower risk of AD development compared to no prescription
> 

> these studies suggest that HSV-1 productive infection or reactivation may promote AD development, which may also be preventable with antiherpetic agents.
