> The general rule of thumb is to inhale through your nose, so the air enters your belly, right before the eccentric (muscle-lengthening) part of the motion.
> 
> Exhale during the concentric (muscle-shortening) part of the motion completely through your mouth.

## Types of Stretches

Generated by MS Co-Pilot:
> **Dynamic Stretches (Before Activity)**:
> 
> - Focus on controlled movements that prepare your muscles for exercise or movement.
> - Examples: Arm circles, leg swings, or walking lunges.
> 
> **Static Stretches (After Activity or During Rest)**:
> 
> - These involve holding a stretch for 15–30 seconds to improve flexibility.
> 
> - Examples: Hamstring stretches, seated forward bends, or shoulder stretches.
> 
> **Active Stretches**:
> 
> - Use your own muscles to hold a stretch without external force.
> 
> - Examples: Stretching your arms overhead while standing or holding a calf stretch.
> 
> **Passive Stretches**:
> 
> - Use external forces like gravity, a strap, or a wall for support.
> 
> - Examples: Lying down with a strap to stretch your hamstrings or leaning against a wall for a chest stretch.
> 
> **PNF Stretching (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation)**:
> 
> - Often used by athletes, this method combines contracting and relaxing the muscle for deeper stretches.
> 
> - Example: Partner-assisted hamstring stretch.
