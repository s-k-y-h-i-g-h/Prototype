# Blue Light
- Blue light suppresses melatonin production (the hormone which sends you to sleep)
- Turn "night light" mode on on all of your devices at night
- Use red LED lights everywhere (or multicoloured LED lights set to red/amber but this is not as good as using red LEDs)

# Sleep Quality
Monitor your sleep quality with a smartwatch or a sleep tracking device.

## How to Fix Low Sleep Quality
Idenfity which stages of sleep you are lacking and use the tips below to fix them.

### Boost REM

Generated by MS Co-Pilot:
> - ✔ Prioritize Consistent Sleep Timing → Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day strengthens REM cycles. 
> - ✔ Limit Alcohol & Late-Night Caffeine → These can suppress REM sleep, even if they don’t affect total sleep duration. 
> - ✔ Increase Natural Light Exposure in the Morning → Getting sunlight in the first hour after waking helps regulate circadian rhythms, ensuring REM cycles happen at the right time. 
> - ✔ Try Magnesium & L-Theanine → Some people find mild sleep supplements can support relaxation and deeper REM phases. 
> - ✔ Reduce Late-Night Screen Time → Optimize blue light exposure, mental stimulation from screens (like intense discussions or gaming) can delay REM onset.

### Practice Yoga Nidra Meditation
- [Yoga nidra practice shows improvement in sleep in patients with chronic insomnia: A randomized controlled trial](https://nmji.in/yoga-nidra-practice-shows-improvement-in-sleep-in-patients-with-chronic-insomnia-a-randomized-controlled-trial/)
> ... interventions showed an improvement in subjective total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, reduction in total wake duration and enhancement in subjective sleep quality. Objectively, both the interventions improved TST and total wake duration and increased N1% of TST. Yoga nidra showed marked improvement in N2% and N3% in TST. Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly after yoga nidra (p=0.041).
