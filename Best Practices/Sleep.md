# Stages of Sleep
## SWS
### How to Get More
- go cycling every day
- increase GABAergic tone before bed with supplements and hormones

### Effects of too Little SWS
Generated by MS Co-Pilot:
> - Persistent fatigue, even after rest
> - Reduced muscle recovery and soreness that lingers
> - Lowered motivation and exercise drive (due to impaired dopamine signaling)
> - Blunted cardiovascular efficiency, making workouts feel harder than they should
> - Without enough of it, your prefrontal cortex (which regulates fear and impulse) becomes less effective, while limbic regions (like the amygdala) become more reactive.
> - This imbalance can lead to:
>     - Heightened baseline arousal
>     - Reduced emotional resilience
>     - A sense of being “on edge” or easily overwhelmed

- Ruminating instead of being present minded

### Effects on the Autonomic Nervous System
Generated by MS Co-Pilot:
> During slow-wave sleep (SWS):
> - The autonomic nervous system is heavily parasympathetic-dominant.
> - Heart rate and blood pressure are at their lowest.
> - Vagal tone peaks, and sympathetic activity is dialed way down.
> - It’s the body’s “rebuild and restore” state—perfect for cellular repair, immune modulation, and energy conservation.
> 
> You could think of SWS as the “deep inhale” of recovery.

## REM
### Effects on the Autonomic Nervous System
Generated by MS Co-Pilot:
> REM: Autonomic Flexibility Gym
>
> A neurologically active, emotionally charged state that:
> - Shows fluctuating heart rate and breathing, with bursts of sympathetic activation.
> - Mimics aspects of waking neurochemistry, particularly in limbic and cholinergic systems.
> - Is thought to rehearse adaptive responses, including switching between sympathetic and parasympathetic tone.
>
> REM is almost like an autonomic training simulator, keeping your system adaptable and emotionally resilient.

# SWS:REM Ratio
## High SWS, Low REM
Generated by MS Co-Pilot:
> The “Overcharged but Uncentered” State.
> - SWS (slow-wave sleep) is deeply restorative for the body and brain. It clears metabolic waste, boosts growth hormone, and stabilizes neural circuits. When you get a lot of it, you often wake up with physical energy and mental clarity.
> - But REM sleep is where emotional regulation, creativity, and behavioral flexibility get tuned. Low REM can leave you feeling less emotionally nuanced, more rigid, or even overstimulated—like your brain is idling high without traction.

> The Flip Side: High REM, Low SWS
> - This often correlates with low motivation, emotional volatility, or even ruminative thinking—especially if REM is fragmented or excessive.
> - You might feel dreamy or introspective but lack drive or groundedness.

# Sleep Deprivation
[Neurobiological Consequences of Sleep Deprivation - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3648777/)

# Blue Light
- Blue light suppresses melatonin production (the hormone which sends you to sleep)
- Turn "night light" mode on on all of your devices at night
- Use red LED lights everywhere (or multicoloured LED lights set to red/amber but this is not as good as using red LEDs)

# Meditation

> meditating twice a day for 20 minutes might reduce the need for sleep (this is debated)

# Sleep Quality
Monitor your sleep quality with a smartwatch or a sleep tracking device.

## How to Fix Low Sleep Quality
Idenfity which stages of sleep you are lacking and use the tips below to fix them.

### Boost REM

Generated by MS Co-Pilot:
> - ✔ Prioritize Consistent Sleep Timing → Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day strengthens REM cycles. 
> - ✔ Limit Alcohol & Late-Night Caffeine → These can suppress REM sleep, even if they don’t affect total sleep duration. 
> - ✔ Increase Natural Light Exposure in the Morning → Getting sunlight in the first hour after waking helps regulate circadian rhythms, ensuring REM cycles happen at the right time. 
> - ✔ Try Magnesium & L-Theanine → Some people find mild sleep supplements can support relaxation and deeper REM phases. 
> - ✔ Reduce Late-Night Screen Time → Optimize blue light exposure, mental stimulation from screens (like intense discussions or gaming) can delay REM onset.

### Practice Yoga Nidra Meditation
- [Yoga nidra practice shows improvement in sleep in patients with chronic insomnia: A randomized controlled trial](https://nmji.in/yoga-nidra-practice-shows-improvement-in-sleep-in-patients-with-chronic-insomnia-a-randomized-controlled-trial/)
> ... interventions showed an improvement in subjective total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, reduction in total wake duration and enhancement in subjective sleep quality. Objectively, both the interventions improved TST and total wake duration and increased N1% of TST. Yoga nidra showed marked improvement in N2% and N3% in TST. Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly after yoga nidra (p=0.041).
