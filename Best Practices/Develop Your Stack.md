# Start With the Basics
## Essential Nutrients
Make sure you are getting RDAs of essential nutrients.

Keep track of what you eat and assess the quantity of essential nutrients in you diet. A lot of people take a high quality multivitamin and other supplements because it is next to impossible to get all of the essential nutrients through diet alone.

### L-Tyrosine
Competes with other amino acids when crossing the BBB. Take this on an empty stomach or before eating things which contain protein.

- Anti-oxidants

### Correct Naturally Declining Levels of Important Endogenous Compounds
(Do these decrease because of the processes of ageing or for other reasons?)

> Two separate meta-analyses found a reduction in stroke occurrence in those who had higher potassium intake. Higher intakes of potassium (greater than 155 millimoles per day) resulted in a 24% reduction in stroke.1415

> Another meta-analysis found an inverse relationship between potassium intake and the risk of stroke. The higher potassium intake was associated with a reduced risk of stroke.16 Approximately 3,500 milligrams (mg) of potassium per day were needed to see the reduced risk.

### Mechanisms of Ageing
#### Genomic Instability
Accumulation of DNA damage over time, leading to errors in genetic information.

#### Telomere Shortening
Telomeres, the protective caps on chromosomes, shorten with each cell division, eventually leading to cellular senescence.

#### Epigenetic Changes
Alterations in gene expression without changes to the DNA sequence, affecting cellular function.

#### Loss of Proteostasis
Decline in the ability to maintain protein quality, leading to the accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins.

#### Mitochondrial Dysfunction
Reduced efficiency of mitochondria, the cell's energy producers, contributing to cellular ageing.

#### Cellular Senescence
Cells lose the ability to divide and function, releasing inflammatory signals that affect surrounding tissues.

#### Stem Cell Exhaustion
Decline in the regenerative capacity of stem cells, impairing tissue repair and maintenance.

#### Deregulated Nutrient Sensing
Disruption in pathways that regulate energy and metabolism, such as insulin signaling.

#### Altered Intercellular Communication
Changes in how cells communicate, often leading to chronic inflammation.

#### Accumulation of Cellular Waste

#### NAD+ Loss

#### Inflammation

#### Dysbiosis
An imbalance in the microbiomeâthe community of microorganisms living in and on your body. This imbalance can occur in various areas, such as the gut, skin, mouth, or genitals, and it can disrupt the beneficial functions these microbes provide.
