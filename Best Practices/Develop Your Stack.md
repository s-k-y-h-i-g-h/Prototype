# Start With the Basics
## Essential Nutrients
Make sure you are getting RDAs of essential nutrients.

Keep track of what you eat and assess the quantity of essential nutrients in you diet. A lot of people take a high quality multivitamin because it is next to impossible to get all of the essential nutrients through diet alone.

### Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) and Adequate Intakes (AIs)

- [Diatery reference intakes for vitamins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t2/?report=objectonly)
- [Diatery reference intakes for water and macronutrients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t4/?report=objectonly)

### Average Requirements
- [Estimated average requirements](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545442/table/appJ_tab1/?report=objectonly)

### Macronutrient Distribution Ranges
- [Acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t5/?report=objectonly)
  
### Upper Intakes
- [Tolerable upper intake levels for vitamins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t7/?report=objectonly)
- [Tolerable upper intake levels for elements](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545442/table/appJ_tab9/?report=objectonly)

### Omega-3 and Omega-6
These need to be consumed in the right ratio. The ideal omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is around 4:1 or lower.

## Prevent Health From Declining

- Anti-oxidants

### Correct Naturally Declining Levels of Important Endogenous Compounds
- Taurine
- CoQ10
- Collagen
- Melatonin
- DHEA
- Glutathione
- Growth hormone (GH)
- NAD+
- Sex hormones
- IGF-1
- Glycine

> Higher intakes of potassium may help prevent stroke.
> Two separate meta-analyses found a reduction in stroke occurrence in those who had higher potassium intake. Higher intakes of potassium (greater than 155 millimoles per day) resulted in a 24% reduction in stroke.1415

> Another meta-analysis found an inverse relationship between potassium intake and the risk of stroke. The higher potassium intake was associated with a reduced risk of stroke.16 Approximately 3,500 milligrams (mg) of potassium per day were needed to see the reduced risk.
