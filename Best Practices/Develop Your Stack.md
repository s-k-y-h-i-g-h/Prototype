# Start With the Basics
## Essential Nutrients
Make sure you are getting RDAs of essential nutrients.

Keep track of what you eat and assess the quantity of essential nutrients in you diet. A lot of people take a high quality multivitamin and other supplements because it is next to impossible to get all of the essential nutrients through diet alone.

### Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) and Adequate Intakes (AIs)
- [Diatery reference intakes for elements](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545442/table/appJ_tab3/?report=objectonly)
- [Diatery reference intakes for vitamins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t2/?report=objectonly)
- [Diatery reference intakes for water and macronutrients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t4/?report=objectonly)

### Average Requirements
- [Estimated average requirements](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545442/table/appJ_tab1/?report=objectonly)

### Macronutrient Distribution Ranges
- [Acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t5/?report=objectonly)
  
### Upper Intakes
- [Tolerable upper intake levels for vitamins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t7/?report=objectonly)

### Omega-3 and Omega-6
These need to be consumed in the right ratio. The ideal omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is around 4:1 or lower.

### L-Tryptophan
Competes with other amino acids when crossing the BBB. Take this on an empty stomach or before eating things which contain protein.

### L-Tyrosine
Competes with other amino acids when crossing the BBB. Take this on an empty stomach or before eating things which contain protein.

## Prevent Health From Declining
### Non-Essential Supplements
- Anti-inflmmatories
- Anti-oxidants

### Correct Naturally Declining Levels of Important Endogenous Compounds
(Do these decrease because of the processes of ageing or for other reasons?)

> Higher intakes of potassium may help prevent stroke.
> Two separate meta-analyses found a reduction in stroke occurrence in those who had higher potassium intake. Higher intakes of potassium (greater than 155 millimoles per day) resulted in a 24% reduction in stroke.1415

> Another meta-analysis found an inverse relationship between potassium intake and the risk of stroke. The higher potassium intake was associated with a reduced risk of stroke.16 Approximately 3,500 milligrams (mg) of potassium per day were needed to see the reduced risk.
