# What Can Be Conditioned?
Generated by MS-Copilot:
> - Autonomic responses
>     - Salivation (parasympathetic)
>     - Heart rate acceleration (sympathetic)
>     - Pupil dilation/constriction
>     - Gut motility, sweating, etc.
>
> - Emotional states
>     - Fear, joy, disgust, calm—all can be conditioned to specific cues.
>     - Example: A smell associated with a traumatic event can trigger anxiety (sympathetic), even years later.
>
> - Motor behaviors
>     - Through operant conditioning, voluntary actions (like pressing a lever or typing a password) can be shaped by rewards or punishments.
>     - These are somatic, not autonomic—but still conditioned.
>
> - Cognitive associations
>     - Beliefs, expectations, and even placebo effects can be conditioned.
>     - Example: If a sugar pill consistently relieves pain, the brain may release endogenous opioids in response to the pill alone.
>
> - Hormonal responses
>     - Some studies show that insulin release can be conditioned to the sight of food, even without ingestion.
>     - Cortisol spikes can also be conditioned to stress-predictive cues.

> - Anchoring (from NLP): Creating a conditioned link between a stimulus (like a gesture or word) and a desired internal state.
> - State conditioning or state anchoring: Often used in performance psychology or meditation training to describe linking a mental/emotional state to a cue.
> - Autonomic conditioning: Specifically refers to conditioning involuntary physiological responses (like HRV, salivation, or vagal tone).
> - Self-conditioning or self-directed conditioning: Informal but increasingly used in biohacking and cognitive training circles.
