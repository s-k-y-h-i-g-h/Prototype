TL;DR - breathe slowly to relax. People use so many fucking words to explain something so simple just skip the rest of this document tbh.

Does sitting in a quiet room with your eyes closed make you aware of your breath or does reading that you should focus on your breath make you focus on your breath or does "focusing" on your breath make you aware of your breath? Which muscle are you using when you focus on a particular part of your body?

> Proper breathing starts in the nose and then moves to the stomach as your diaphragm contracts, the belly expands and your lungs fill with air. "It is the most efficient way to breathe, as it pulls down on the lungs, creating negative pressure in the chest, resulting in air flowing into your lungs.”

> Also [pay attention to air quality](https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/) in your area and monitor daily levels as irritants, pollution and allergens can affect breathing.

> Breathing out of your nose will be more of a challenge when you are sick and have nasal congestion, but staying hydrated can help, Courtney says. "Hydration helps thin secretions and helps the mouth and throat add humidity to the air we breathe.”

> # **Diaphragmatic breathing steps**
> 
> A person can perform the following steps while lying down or sitting up straight in a chair.
> 
> 1. Place both hands on the abdomen, feeling the rise and fall of each breath.
> 2. Close the mouth and take a slow breath in through the nose, while feeling the abdomen rise and inflate like a balloon.
> 3. Breathe out slowly through pursed lips, as if blowing bubbles, with each expiratory breath taking about two to three times as long as each inhalation.
> 4. Repeat these steps for 5–10 minutes. Keep the hands on the abdomen to help improve awareness of the correct breathing technique.

> To use the 4-7-8 technique, focus on the following breathing pattern:
> 
> - emptying the lungs of air
> - breathing in quietly through the nose for 4 seconds
> - holding the breath for a count of 7 seconds
> - exhaling forcefully through the mouth, pursing the lips, and making a “whoosh” sound for 8 seconds
> - repeating the cycle up to 4 times

> This breathing pattern aims to reduce [anxiety](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323454) or help people get to sleep. It is a form of pranayama, which is the practice of breath regulation. Pranayama is common in [yoga](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/286745).
