# The Vagus Nerve
- [The Impact of Breathing on the Vagus Nerve: A Comprehensive Guide](https://vagusnerve.com/the-impact-of-breathing-on-the-vagus-nerve-a-comprehensive-guide/)
> The vagus nerve, also known as the tenth cranial nerve, is the longest and most complex nerve in the human body. It originates in the brainstem and extends down to the abdomen, innervating various organs along the way. This nerve plays a crucial role in the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls our body’s rest-and-digest response. It is responsible for regulating heart rate, digestion, breathing, and many other bodily functions.
>
> When we breathe deeply and slowly, we engage the diaphragm and activate the vagus nerve. This type of breathing stimulates the baroreceptors, specialized sensors located in the blood vessels, heart, and lungs. The baroreceptors send signals to the brain, which in turn adjusts our heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. By consciously controlling our breath, we can promote vagal tone, leading to a more balanced autonomic nervous system response.

# Techniques
## General
- (Five Ways You Might Be Breathing Wrong)[https://www.lung.org/blog/you-might-be-breathing-wrong]
> Proper breathing starts in the nose and then moves to the stomach as your diaphragm contracts, the belly expands and your lungs fill with air. "It is the most efficient way to breathe, as it pulls down on the lungs, creating negative pressure in the chest, resulting in air flowing into your lungs.”

## Pursed Lip Breathing
> Ideally, people should practice both exercises for [5–10 minutes every day](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/wellness/breathing-exercises). Some people may need to build up to this duration gradually.
> 
> 1. Sit down in a chair and relax the neck and shoulder muscles.
> 2. Breathe in slowly through the nose while keeping the mouth closed. Inhale for 2 seconds.
> 3. Pucker or purse the lips, as if whistling or blowing out a candle. Exhale slowly for 4 seconds.
> 4. Repeat the above steps.

## Diaphragmatic Breathing
> Ideally, people should practice ... for [5–10 minutes every day](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/wellness/breathing-exercises). Some people may need to build up to this duration gradually.
> 
> A person can perform the following steps while lying down or sitting up straight in a chair.
> 
> 1. Place both hands on the abdomen, feeling the rise and fall of each breath.
> 2. Close the mouth and take a slow breath in through the nose, while feeling the abdomen rise and inflate like a balloon.
> 3. Breathe out slowly through pursed lips, as if blowing bubbles, with each expiratory breath taking about two to three times as long as each inhalation.
> 4. Repeat these steps for 5–10 minutes. Keep the hands on the abdomen to help improve awareness of the correct breathing technique.

## 4-7-8
> To use the 4-7-8 technique, focus on the following breathing pattern:
> 
> - emptying the lungs of air
> - breathing in quietly through the nose for 4 seconds
> - holding the breath for a count of 7 seconds
> - exhaling forcefully through the mouth, pursing the lips, and making a “whoosh” sound for 8 seconds
> - repeating the cycle up to 4 times
> 
> This breathing pattern aims to reduce [anxiety](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323454) or help people get to sleep. It is a form of pranayama, which is the practice of breath regulation. Pranayama is common in [yoga](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/286745).

> Then let it flow out gently, counting from 1 to 5 again, if you find this helpful.
> Keep doing this for at least 5 minutes.
