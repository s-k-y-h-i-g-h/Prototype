# One Meal A Day (OMAD)
## Increased Risk of CVD (Unconfirmed)
- [8-hour time-restricted eating linked to a 91% higher risk of cardiovascular death](https://newsroom.heart.org/news/8-hour-time-restricted-eating-linked-to-a-91-higher-risk-of-cardiovascular-death)

This might be a result of spiking electrolyte levels after the meal and/or low electrolyte levels during the fasting window. I wonder if eating a meal relatively low in electrolytes and supplementing electrolytes throughout the day would decrease the risk of CVD.

## Adaptation
- Sympathetic nervous system will be more active while fasting, especially in the early stages of adaptation
- Baseline stress response will become normalised later

# Things To Avoid
- Meat (carcinogenic)

# Supplementing Amino Acids While Fasting
