# One Meal A Day (OMAD)
## Increased Risk of CVD (Unconfirmed)
- [8-hour time-restricted eating linked to a 91% higher risk of cardiovascular death](https://newsroom.heart.org/news/8-hour-time-restricted-eating-linked-to-a-91-higher-risk-of-cardiovascular-death)

This might be a result of spiking electrolyte levels after the meal and/or low electrolyte levels during the fasting window. I wonder if eating a meal relatively low in electrolytes and supplementing electrolytes throughout the day would decrease the risk of CVD.

## Adaptation
- Sympathetic nervous system will be more active while fasting, especially in the early stages of adaptation
- Baseline stress response will become normalised later

# Things To Avoid
- Meat (carcinogenic)

# Fasting
## Effects
### ⏱️ 0–12 Hours After Eating: Early Longevity-Linked Effects
Generated by MS Co-Pilot:
> 1. **Insulin levels drop**  
>    As glucose from your last meal is used up, insulin secretion decreases. This shift:  
>    - Reduces fat storage  
>    - Promotes metabolic flexibility  
>    - Lowers mTOR activity (a key aging-related growth signal)
> 
> 2. **Glycogen depletion begins**  
>    Your liver begins using glycogen stores for energy, which:  
>    - Prepares the body to switch to fat metabolism  
>    - Is a prerequisite for ketogenesis and autophagy
> 
> 3. **AMPK activation increases**  
>    With lower cellular energy, AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) ramps up. This:  
>    - Boosts mitochondrial biogenesis  
>    - Inhibits mTOR  
>    - Enhances stress resilience and repair
> 
> 4. **mTOR suppression begins**  
>    Lower insulin and amino acid availability dampens mTOR signaling, which:  
>    - Slows down cellular growth  
>    - Encourages maintenance and longevity pathways
> 
> 5. **Mild hormetic stress response**  
>    The early fast acts as a metabolic challenge, triggering:  
>    - Antioxidant defenses  
>    - Expression of genes linked to stress resistance (e.g., `FOXO`, `SIRT1`)


## Supplementing Amino Acids While Fasting

> likely blunts or delays some of the fasting-induced pathways—particularly autophagy and ketogenesis. Tryptophan also increases serotonin, which may affect appetite and circadian signaling.

## Supplementing Micronutrients When Fasting
Generated by MS Co-Pilot:
> - The current consensus among fasting-savvy clinicians and biohackers is that electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium) are not only safe but crucial—especially beyond 24 hours2.
> - Water-soluble vitamins (like B-complex and vitamin C) are often recommended, especially if you’re fasting frequently or have a low baseline intake.
> - Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) are trickier—they often come in oil-based capsules, which can technically break a fast depending on your goals.
