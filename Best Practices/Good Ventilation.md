> Here's a breakdown of how different CO2 levels in indoor spaces can affect mental well-being and cognitive function:
>
> **400–600 ppm (Baseline Levels)**:
> 
> This is typical for outdoor air and well-ventilated indoor spaces.
> 
> No noticeable effects on mental well-being or cognition.
> 
> **600–1,000 ppm (Moderate Levels)**:
> 
> Common in many indoor environments like offices and classrooms.
> 
> Cognitive performance may begin to decline slightly, particularly in tasks requiring higher-order decision-making.
> 
> **1,000–1,400 ppm (Elevated Levels)**:
> 
> At this range, studies have shown a 15–50% decrease in cognitive function, including decision-making and problem-solving abilities2.
> 
> Symptoms like mild fatigue and reduced focus may appear.
> 
> **1,400–2,000 ppm (High Levels)**:
> 
> Cognitive impairments become more pronounced, with noticeable difficulty concentrating and maintaining attention.
> 
> Physical symptoms like headaches, drowsiness, and slight nausea may occur.
> 
> **2,000–4,000 ppm (Very High Levels)**:
> 
> Significant cognitive decline, including poor concentration and memory issues.
> 
> Physical symptoms intensify, with increased heart rate, dizziness, and more pronounced fatigue.
> 
> **4,000+ ppm (Extreme Levels)**:
> 
> Severe effects on both mental and physical well-being.
> 
> Symptoms include confusion, nausea, and a sense of "thick" or oppressive air.
> 
> Prolonged exposure can lead to long-term health risks.
> 
> Improving ventilation and air circulation can help mitigate these effects. Regularly opening windows, using air purifiers, or monitoring CO2 levels with sensors are practical steps to maintain a healthier  indoor environment.
>
> **Indoor Accumulation**: In small, poorly ventilated spaces, CO2 levels can rise significantly due to human respiration. For example:
> 
> - A single person in a small, enclosed space can increase CO2 levels to 1,000–2,000 ppm over time.
> 
> - In bedrooms, CO2 levels can often exceed 2,000 ppm overnight if windows are closed.
> 
> - In extreme cases, levels in small, sealed spaces can reach 4,000 ppm or higher, which can cause noticeable symptoms like fatigue, headaches, and reduced cognitive function.

# Seasonal Affective Disorder?

How often do you think people feel down during the winter simply because they do not open their windows and end up suffering from too much CO2? Don't a lot of people report depressive symptoms in the winter? Couldn't that be fatigue from too much CO2?
