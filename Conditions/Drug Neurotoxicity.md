> pretreatment with low-dose METH may be protective against METH neurotoxicity in the midbrain, leading to the suppression of oxidative stress and apoptotic mechanisms, in part via ERS-related pathways.
>
> One factor that has been heavily implicated in this METH-induced damage to the dopaminergic system is the activation of D1 DA receptors. Even when METH-induced hyperthermia is maintained, the coadministration of a D1 DA receptor antagonist protects against METH-induced neurotoxicity, strongly suggesting that D1 DA receptors play an important role in METH-induced neurotoxicity

> Long-term misuse of kratom may present with nonfocal neuropathies, seizures, hepatotoxicity, and rhabdomyolysis.
> Presenting symptoms reported in the literature include nondermatomal sensory and motor neuropathies, ataxia, seizures, hepatotoxicity, and rhabdomyolysis.
> Symptoms are more frequent and severe with higher doses of kratom abuse and typically gradually improve following cessation.
