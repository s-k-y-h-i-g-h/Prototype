# Mechanisms
- [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.4137/IJTR.S11355](Role of NAD+, Oxidative Stress, and Tryptophan Metabolism in Autism Spectrum Disorders)
> Studies suggest that oxidative stress-induced mechanisms and reduced antioxidant defense, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired energy metabolism (NAD+, NADH, ATP, pyruvate, and lactate), are major causes of ASD.

## Serotonin/Tryptophan
- [Tryptophan status in autism spectrum disorder and the influence of supplementation on its level](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11011-017-0045-x)
> These results assess that the Trp level in ASD subjects is critical and that intake of B vitamins and magnesium with diet might influence its metabolic homeostasis.

> Increased plasma cortisol/ dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate ratio is evident in ASD, and is significantly decreased by serotonin precursor administration
> Overall serotonin is relevant to ASD etiology and course and for some may be an important treatment target.

"Autism" is more than one condition and this is evident if you look at things like serotonin level in autistic people because some autists have elevated serotonin and some have too little. Serotonin is also tied to sound sensitivity so it's not surprising that there are autists with high serotonin levels and autists with too much sound sensitivity and it's not surprising that there is a lot of variation in the autistic population's sound sensitivities.

# Treatment
- [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3964746/](Redox Regulation and the Autistic Spectrum: Role of Tryptophan Catabolites, Immuno-inflammation, Autoimmunity and the Amygdala)
> many studies have shown efficacy of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory treatments, as well as treatment targeted to amygdala functioning, including hydrogen, oxytocin and NAD+, vitamin and mineral supplementation, naltrexone, DSMA metal detoxification, GSH and N-acetylcysteine. It should be noted that many of the pharmaceutical used to treat ASD are also powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, including antidepressants

> Some rhesus monkeys naturally exhibit low-social tendencies, similar to individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Scientists found that these monkeys had lower vasopressin levels in their cerebrospinal fluid. By administering nebulized vasopressin, researchers observed significant improvements in social interactions, including increased engagement and recognition of familiar faces.
