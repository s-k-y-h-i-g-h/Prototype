> CBD may be particularly effective in the early stages of the disorder, such as in patients at clinical high risk and those with first episode psychosis

# Life Expectancy
- [text](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6235075/)
> People with schizophrenia have a life expectancy 15 to 20 years shorter than the general population; most of these premature deaths are due to cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases  
> Between 1993 and 2012 in Ontario, people with schizophrenia experienced 3 times greater mortality rates ... with circulatory disease accounting for most deaths  

## Prevention of Diseases
- Add medicines/supplements which lower the risk of cardiovascular, chronic respiratory and circulatory diseases here
