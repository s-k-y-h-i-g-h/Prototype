# Mechanisms of Action
## AMPA PAMs
- [Aniracetam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aniracetam)
> has been shown to positively modulate the AMPA receptor.
- [Piracetam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracetam)
> is a positive allosteric modulator of the AMPA receptor, although this action is very weak and its clinical effects may not necessarily be mediated by this action. It is hypothesized to act on ion channels or ion carriers, thus leading to increased neuron excitability

## HIF-1 Agonists
- [Noopept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Phenylacetyl-L-prolylglycine_ethyl_ester)
> studies suggest that the pharmacological properties of Noopept are derived from its action as an activator of Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1).

## GABA
### GABA-A Agonists
- [Nefiracetam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefiracetam)
> shows high affinity for the GABAA receptor (IC50) = 8.5 nM), where it is presumed to be an agonist.

### GABA-B Agonists
- [Phenibut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenibut)
> acts as a full agonist of the GABAB receptor

## Dopamine
## Reuptake Inhibitor
- [Pemoline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemoline)
> a selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor

## Releasing Agent
- [Pemoline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemoline)
> weakly stimulates dopamine release

## Acetylcholine
### α4β2 Agonists
- [Phenylpiracetam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylpiracetam)
> binds to α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the mouse brain cortex
