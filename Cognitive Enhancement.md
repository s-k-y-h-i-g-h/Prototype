# Mechanisms of Action
## AMPA PAMs
- [Aniracetam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aniracetam)
> has been shown to positively modulate the AMPA receptor.
- [Piracetam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracetam)
> is a positive allosteric modulator of the AMPA receptor, although this action is very weak and its clinical effects may not necessarily be mediated by this action. It is hypothesized to act on ion channels or ion carriers, thus leading to increased neuron excitability

## HIF-1
### Activators
- [Noopept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Phenylacetyl-L-prolylglycine_ethyl_ester)
> studies suggest that the pharmacological properties of Noopept are derived from its action as an activator of Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1).

### Inhibitors
- [Roxadustat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxadustat)
> a HIF prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor that increases endogenous production of erythropoietin and stimulates production of hemoglobin and red blood cells

## GlyT1
### Inhibitors
- [Sarcosine](https://examine.com/supplements/sarcosine/)
> main mechanism involves inhibiting a transporter, called GlyT1

## GABA
### Pro-Drug
- [Picamilon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picamilon)
> It is believed that picamilon is hydrolyzed into GABA and niacin

### GABA-A Agonists
- [Nefiracetam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefiracetam)
> shows high affinity for the GABAA receptor (IC50) = 8.5 nM), where it is presumed to be an agonist.

### GABA-B Agonists
- [Phenibut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenibut)
> acts as a full agonist of the GABAB receptor

## Serotonin
### Inhibitors
- [PRL-8-53](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRL-8-53)
> partially inhibiting serotonin

- [SAMe](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/200203/the-sam-e-story?msockid=24c4967d2a9a676c081d82b12b7a6635)
> activates such big-time biochemicals as the neurotransmitters serotonin

## Dopamine
### Potentiators
- [PRL-8-53](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRL-8-53)
> potentiates dopamine

### Reuptake Inhibitor
- [Pemoline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemoline)
> a selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor

### Releasing Agent
- [Pemoline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemoline)
> weakly stimulates dopamine release

### Activators
- [SAMe](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/200203/the-sam-e-story?msockid=24c4967d2a9a676c081d82b12b7a6635)
> activates such big-time biochemicals as the neurotransmitters ... dopamine

## Acetylcholine
### Precursors
- [Phosphatidylcholine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylcholine)

### Cholinergics
- [PRL-8-53](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRL-8-53)
> displays possible cholinergic properties

### α4β2 Agonists
- [Phenylpiracetam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylpiracetam)
> binds to α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the mouse brain cortex

### High-Affinity Choline Uptake Stimulation
- [Pramiracetam](https://rhtp.org/pramiracetam/)
> it stimulates the high-affinity choline uptake, a precursor to acetylcholine

## MAO
### MAO-A
#### Inhibitors
- [Selegiline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selegiline)
> At higher doses, it loses its specificity for MAO-B and also inhibits monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), which increases serotonin and norepinephrine levels in the brain as well

### MAO-B
#### Inhibitors
- [Selegiline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selegiline)
> a selective and irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), increasing brain levels of dopamine

## Vitamins
- [PQQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrroloquinoline_quinone)
> a "longevity vitamin" not essential for immediate survival, but necessary for long-term health

## Not Yet Understood
- [Oxiracetam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxiracetam)
