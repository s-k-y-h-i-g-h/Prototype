mTOR Inhibitors / Autophagy Enhancers
Rapamycin / Sirolimus: Inhibits mTORC1, which reduces protein synthesis, promotes autophagy, and mimics caloric restriction benefits. One of the most potent pharmacological aging regulators.

Metformin: Activates AMPK, inhibits mTOR indirectly, improves insulin sensitivity, lowers inflammation, and reduces mitochondrial ROS. Mimics effects of calorie restriction.

Resveratrol: Activates SIRT1, which deacetylates proteins involved in aging and inflammation. Also modulates AMPK and mimics calorie restriction effects.

Calorie restriction / Macronutrient balance: Lowers insulin/IGF-1 signaling, activates AMPK and sirtuins, inhibits mTOR. Enhances mitochondrial efficiency and autophagy.

Lifestyle Interventions
Sleep quality: Regulates circadian genes (e.g., CLOCK, BMAL1), improves hormone regulation, reduces cortisol and inflammation, supports brain and metabolic health.

Exercise: Enhances mitochondrial biogenesis (via PGC-1α), increases autophagy, insulin sensitivity, and neurotrophic factors like BDNF. Also lowers systemic inflammation.

Hormonal / Signaling Molecules
Klotho: A longevity-associated protein. Regulates phosphate/calcium balance, protects against oxidative stress, and inhibits Wnt signaling (pro-aging).

PF4 (Platelet factor 4): May rejuvenate hematopoietic stem cells; involved in immune regulation and inflammation, showing age-related functional decline.

Mitochondrial Function & NAD+
NAD+ enhancers (e.g., NR, NMN): Boost intracellular NAD+, improving mitochondrial function, DNA repair via PARPs, and sirtuin activity (especially SIRT1/3).

Glycan / ECM Modulators
Hyaluronic acid: Maintains extracellular matrix and skin integrity. May affect inflammation and cellular senescence indirectly via ECM signaling.

Amino Acids & Small Molecules
Taurine: Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, supports mitochondrial function and membrane stabilization. May regulate calcium signaling and bile acid metabolism.

Glycine: Anti-inflammatory, supports collagen synthesis and glutathione production. Enhances metabolic health and sleep.

Spermidine: Induces autophagy, improves mitochondrial function, and maintains proteostasis. Promotes cardiovascular and cognitive health.

Glucosamine: Anti-inflammatory, may mimic calorie restriction by impairing glycolysis (via hexosamine pathway).

Senolytics / Senomorphics
Quercetin / Fisetin / Dasatinib / Piperlongumine / Curcumin: These clear senescent cells (senolytics) or suppress their inflammatory secretions (senomorphics). Work through multiple pathways (e.g., Bcl-2 inhibition, ROS increase).

ABT-263 (Navitoclax): Bcl-2 family inhibitor — promotes apoptosis in senescent cells by blocking anti-apoptotic signaling.

17α-oestradiol: Non-feminizing estrogen analog; improves metabolic health and insulin sensitivity in male mice; possible sex-specific effects on aging.

Procyanidin C1 / Gingerenone A: Natural polyphenols with anti-inflammatory and senolytic activity, targeting oxidative stress and SASP factors.

Chaperone / Heat Shock Protein Modulators
17-DMAG (and other HSP90 inhibitors): Disrupt protein chaperone complexes in cancer and senescent cells — leads to proteostasis imbalance and cell death.

Epigenetic Modifiers (BET, BRD, USP7, MDM2)
JQ1, I-BET151, I-BET762, ARV825, OTX015, PFI-1JQ1: BET inhibitors — block BRD4 binding to acetylated histones, suppress inflammatory and oncogenic gene transcription.

USP7 inhibitors (P5091, P22077): Inhibit deubiquitinase USP7, leading to p53 activation and senescent/cancer cell apoptosis.

RG-7112: MDM2 antagonist — stabilizes p53, promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in damaged/senescent cells.

Cardiac Glycosides (Natural Senolytics)
Bufalin, Cinobufagin, Convallatoxin, Digoxin, Ouabain, Proscillaridin A, Peruvocide: Inhibit Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase, increase intracellular Ca²⁺, induce ROS, and preferentially kill senescent cells.

Metabolic / Lipid Regulators
Fenofibrate: PPARα agonist, enhances fatty acid oxidation, reduces triglycerides, improves mitochondrial function.

Macrolide Antibiotics (Immune Modulation)
Azithromycin / Roxithromycin: Beyond antibiotics, they modulate immune responses and may exhibit senolytic activity or reduce chronic inflammation in aged tissues.

Others
Acarbose: Inhibits alpha-glucosidase, blunts postprandial glucose spikes, lowers insulin/IGF-1 signaling — associated with lifespan extension in mice.

Lithium: Inhibits GSK-3β, modulates Wnt signaling, neuroprotective, may induce autophagy and support mitochondrial health.

Reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Inhibit LINE-1 retrotransposons, which become active in aging and drive genomic instability and inflammation.

Systemic circulating factors (young blood / plasma dilution): Factors like GDF11, TIMP2, oxytocin, etc., can rejuvenate aged tissues; reduce pro-inflammatory or pro-aging signals in plasma.
