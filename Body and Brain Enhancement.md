> At 10mg, Dr. Reza Naghii of the University of Medical Sciences in Iran found significant reductions of SHBG after just one week
- [BPC-157](https://www.peptides.org/bpc-157/), [BPC-157](https://examine.com/supplements/bpc-157/)
> BPC-157 is known to stimulate vascular endothelial growth factor, which triggers the formation of blood vessels. Also, it blocks the growth-inhibiting action of 4‐hydroxynonenal. Further, it upregulates multiple growth receptors in the body and stimulates the production of fibroblasts, vital to the synthesis of collagen.
>  has various possible (potentially overlapping) mechanisms of action, including promoting nitric oxide synthesis, activating cells involved in tissue repair, stimulating the synthesis of growth factors, and inhibiting inflammation

> is more bioavailable than thiamine salts, providing higher levels of thiamine in muscle, brain, liver, and kidney.
> acts by modulating the advanced glycation end products (AGEs). It can also act through non-AGE dependent pathways.
>  In the case of diabetes, benfotiamine increases transketolase activity, an important enzyme in glucose metabolism, and as a result, blocks three of the major molecular pathways leading to hyperglycemic damage. It prevents the increase in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and enhances hexosamine pathway activity that decreases the buildup of detrimental glucose metabolites that can lead to advanced glycation end products (AGE). Benfotiamine also normalizes protein kinase C (PKC) activity and prevents nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) activation in the retina of diabetics.5 In addition, benfotiamine corrects imbalances in the polyol pathway by decreasing aldose reductase activity, sorbitol concentrations, and intracellular glucose, thereby protecting endothelial cells from glucose-induced damage.6 Benfotiamine also corrects glucose-induced endothelial cell damage by normalizing cell replication rates7 and decreasing apoptosis.
